                        the group, Game Dev Bureau, came up and created all the art, design and functionality of the game, minus some
                        provided assets.

                     <p>
                        Cyber Wide Delivery is a 2.5D platformer that uses an interesting mechanic of a teleporter gun, the player
                        can use the gun and teleport to the projectile, using this to clear puzzless and the platforming of the game.

                        where managable and interensting, given the short period of time we had (3 months) to create the game, also
                        having in mind bugs, design changes, sound, menus, etc.

                        The project for Meta Maniacs was a simple DEMO for a future game, 
                        similar to Fall Guys but a lot more challenging to the player and giving a sense of speedrun to the player,
                        Greatest part of this project was using the provided characters from Meta Maniacs.

                     <p>
                        For this project and the short period of time we had (5 Weeks) I implemented mechanics simple mechanics like 
                        respawn/checkpoint systems, an obstacle spawner, created sections of the playable area so that not everything would be
                        active at the same time. The main focus was on bringing the characters to this simple and fun playable arena.
